# Reverse Each Word

Write a method that takes a sentence and returns it with each word reversed in place.

This is not a simple `.reverse` method.

```ruby
def reverse_each_word(sentence)
  # do your magic here
end

# reverse_each_word("Hello there, and how are you?")
#=> "olleH ,ereht dna woh era ?uoy"
```
